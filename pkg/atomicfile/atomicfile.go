// Package atomicfile writes a file so a reader never sees a partial one.
//
// Every file this gateway keeps is read back by the next process that starts:
// the encryption key, the credentials it protects, the session mapping and the
// transcripts. A plain write truncates the file first, so a crash or a full
// disk in the middle of it leaves a shorter file that still parses as itself.
// A half-written encryption key makes every stored credential unreadable.
